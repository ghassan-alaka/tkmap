Installation:

A few items are required to run tkmap:

1.  GrADS.  You can get the most recent version at http://cola.gmu.edu/grads/. 
2.  tkmap.sh.  This script runs tkmap and creates all the necessary output.  You must modify the last line of this script to point to GrADS.
3.  An executable for tkmap (xtkmap).  If you are on a mac, you can download this executable directly.  Otherwise, you must compile the code (tkmap.f) using a fortran compiler to create the xtkmap file (example:  gfortran -o xtkmap tkmap.f).
4.  plotdrops.gs.  This is a GrADS script that will plot the flight track.
5.  Four files that allow GrADS to run (ens.ctl, ensc0.t00z.pgrbf00, ensc0.t00z.pgrbf00.gmp, ensc0.t00z.pgrbf00.idx).
6.  Three files for plotting the locations of RAOB observations (stnlist00, stnlist12, stnlist0012).                                                    

Running:

This program creates three output files required by AOC to file a flight plan:  a file of turn points, a file of drop locations, and a graphical version of these text files.  The points can be input as latitude/longitude locations or by distance and direction from the center of the tropical cyclone.  In the latter case, the program has the option of accounting for the storm motion during the flight.  The total time of the proposed flight is calculated, with time added for each turn to allow for the added time necessary for that maneuver.  The ground speed of the P-3s are calculated based upon the proposed height of the mission; the ground speeds of the other aircraft are constants.

To run the program, you will need to create an ascii file for each plane with the turn and drop locations for the flight (more on this shortly).   The files must be in the directory in which the script resides and must be names currentX.ftk, where X is either 1, 2, or 3, depending upon the number of planes for the mission.  If only one plane is to be used, neither current2.ftk nor current3.ftk can exist.  [The code can be updated to account for more aircraft.]

The program will print two tables, one listing the turn points, and one with the drop points, with total distance and time to each, and the map.  The tables will be called turnX.txt and dropX.txt, with X having the same meaning as above.

The input file is basically just a sequential list of lats, lons and altitudes.  An example is given below.  On the first line you must specify the aircraft and takeoff time (dd/hhmmZ).  

42 - NOAA P-3:   FL=5000:218kt; FL=6000:223kt; FL=7000:227kt; FL=8000:232kt; FL=9000:237kt; FL=10000:242kt; FL=11000:247kt; FL 12000:252kt; FL=14000:264kt; FL=18000:288kt; FL>=20000:300kt
43 - NOAA P-3:	 same as NOAA 42
49 - NOAA G-IV:  FL=41000-45000:442kt
50 - AF C-130J:  FL=18000-25000:290kt  
51 - NASA DC-8:  FL:18000-25000:350kt 
52 - GLOBAL HAWK:FL=55000-60000:335kt
57 - NASA WB-57: FL>=60000:400kt; FL=55000:550kt; FL=50000:500kt; FL=45000:450kt; FL<=40000:300kt)

You may optionally include a title (like the storm or experiment name).  On subsequent lines, the first character indicates what type of data follow.  

The next line will have the location of the storm or target and its expected motion vector.
**NOTE**
the storm motion can be the motion at take-off time or if the storm is expected to accelerate during the mission, a mean storm motion can be used
**NOTE**

H Lat Lon Dir Spd

Follow the "H" by the lat and lon in decimal degrees at the time on the previous line (with north and west positive), then a motion vector (toward decimal degrees and speed in kt).  So the first two lines of the input file might look like this:

49 07/1800Z Genesis
H 18.5 82.5 270 12

the storm position should be the position at the time of take-offâ€¦this is especially important if storm relative points are included in the track (see below) 

The next line specifies the takeoff location.  A city name (all CAPS) from the following list must be specified for take-off (A) and landing (Z):

What follows will be a sequential list of turn and drop points and altitudes, one on each line.  The first character in each line indicates the type of point.  Turn points (with no drops) are indicated by a "T".   A blank in the first character (the default) means that the point is both a turn and a drop point.  The location is specified by lat and lon.

You may also specify locations relative to the storm location (the "H"  line in the file).  This is done by specifying the storm-relative radius (nm) and azimuth (deg from N).  The following example places sondes at 180, 135, 90, 60, and 30 nm from the center on the 330 degree azimuth, and then another sonde at the center, all at 8000 feet altitude:

S 180 330 8000
S 135 330 8000
S 90 330 8000
S 60 330 8000
S 30 330 8000
S 0 0 8000

Adding intermediate drop points between way points:

The following example will distribute evenly 4 sondes between the turns (and drops) at 15N 70.5W and 15N 60W (note that the flight level altitude must be included in the interpolate line and that these interpolated points are added to the dropsX.txt file, but not to the turnsX.txt file.
  15 70.5 8000
I 4 8000
  15 60 8000

The last line in the file indicates the recovery site.  It must begin with a "Z".  The same list of cities can be used, or specify the site by lat and lon.  


Once the files are complete, type "tkmap.sh."  The graphics will be written to the screen; if you wish to remove this capability, edit the file tkmap.sh and change "-l" in the last line to "-lb." 

Running tkmap.sh will create the output files and the map.  It should take just a couple of seconds.  The output files will be ftk.png (graphics) and turnsX.txt and  dropsX.txt, where N is the number from currentX.ftk.  Check to make sure that the flight duration is within the limits (below) and that the graphics look fine.

Maximum P-3 Flight Durations (determined by landing site):
Bermuda: 8.0 hr (~2150 nm)
Barbados/St. Croix: 9.0 hr (~2400 nm)
Mainland: 9.0 hr (~2400 nm)
P-3 2015 engine upgrade allows for up to 11.0 hr (~2900 nm) nm)
11.0 hr flight consideration: slips in take-off time will result the following day (crew rest requirements)

Maximum G-IV Flight Durations (determined by landing site):
Bermuda: 7.5 hr (~3300 nm)
Barbados/St. Croix: 8.0 hr (~3500 nm)
Mainland: 8.5 hr (~3750 nm)

Maximum Global Hawk Flight Duration
All deployment sites: ~24.0 hr (~8,000 nm)
24.0 hr includes ~30 min for the initial climb out plus ~30 in for the final decent out of/back to NASA Armstrong/Wallops. 
tkmap automatically adds 30-min & 167.5 nm to the track after take-off and after the last way point to account for these aircraft maneuvers
